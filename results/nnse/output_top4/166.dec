-lrb- cnn -rrb- one year after it was perpetrated , the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend : hundreds of teenaged girls , just finishing school , destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped , never to be seen again .
the girls were abducted on the night of april 14-15 , 2014 , in the town of chibok , in northeastern nigeria , about a two-hour drive from the border with cameroon .
they were between 16 and 18 years old .
on tuesday , malala yousafzai , the 17-year-old pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls ' education , sent a message to the kidnapped girls .
