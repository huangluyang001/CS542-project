-lrb- rolling stone -rrb- one summer a few years ago , frances bean cobain worked as an intern in the new york offices of rolling stone .
frances -- the daughter of nirvana singer-guitarist kurt cobain and an executive producer of the new hbo documentary on his life , `` kurt cobain : montage of heck '' -- was `` a 15-year-old goth kid , so stoked , '' she recalls with a laugh during a recent interview for the cover story in our new issue .
she remembers providing research assistance on a cover about the jonas brothers -- and working in a cubicle across from a wall with a giant painting of kurt .
`` yeah , '' frances says with a grin and mock-exasperation , `` looking at my dad every day . ''
