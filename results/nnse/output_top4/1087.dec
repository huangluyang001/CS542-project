-lrb- cnn -rrb- the onslaught on houthis rebels in yemen continued tuesday , with the saudi-led coalition asserting increasing control while locals fled the chaos and casualties piled up -- dozens of civilians among them .
five days after their first airstrikes , the coalition has destroyed air defense systems of the houthis and supporters of yemen 's longtime president ali abdullah saleh , and rendered all but a fraction of air bases and stripes unusable , a saudi source said .
saudi arabia 's navy now controls all yemeni ports , allowing only closely watched non-military medical goods to pass its blockade , according to the source .
this effort is n't over , including widespread attempts to locate and destroy scud missiles still in the country , the source said .
