-lrb- cnn -rrb- tickets will go on sale after an agreement on allocation was reached for the may 2 fight between floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao .
in what pacquiao 's promoter , bob arum , dubbed the `` fight of the century , '' disagreements have hampered the release of the tickets because of questions over how many tickets would be allocated to each fighter for the highly-anticipated las vegas event .
the cheapest tickets for the bout are priced at $ 1,500 but demand for the fight is such that some seats could fetch as much as $ 11,000 on the secondary market .
kenny bayless has been named as the referee of next month 's fight between mayweather and pacquiao .
