-lrb- cnn -rrb- mercedes driver and f1 championship leader lewis hamilton stole pole position for sunday 's chinese grand prix from teammate and fierce rival nico rosberg in dramatic fashion .
hamilton took first place on the front row on the last lap , beating rosberg by a slim four hundredths of a second margin .
the german appeared upset as he left his car and refused to shake hamilton 's hand .
he did , however , find time to congratulate fellow german driver sebastian vettel , who will start in third after the ferrari driver surprisingly won the malaysian gp two weeks ago .
