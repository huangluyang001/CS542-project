shanghai , china -lrb- cnn -rrb- when china 's biggest auto show opens in shanghai this week , the only models on display will be the ones with four wheels .
gone , show organizers hope , will be the scantily-clad `` car babes '' that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9-day event .
the focus , instead , will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers , which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world 's largest car market .
vehicle sales in china totaled 23.5 million units last year , almost a third more than in the united states .
