hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- phil rudd , the drummer for legendary hard rock band ac/dc , has pleaded guilty to charges of threatening to kill and possession of drugs in a new zealand court .
rudd , who previously denied all allegations , made a surprise guilty plea tuesday before the trial began .
the 60-year-old australian was arrested in november last year after police found methamphetamine and cannabis while executing a search warrant at his home in new zealand .
according to a court summary , rudd fired several employees because the release of his solo album in august had flopped in the charts .
