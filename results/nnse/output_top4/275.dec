-lrb- cnn -rrb- i remember traveling one day in the local train in mumbai with my mother , my younger sister and brother .
i was 13 years old .
i never told anyone about that day until recently .
twenty-five years later , i continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces .
