-lrb- cnn -rrb- on october 31 , 2014 , the italian government announced the end of `` mare nostrum '' -- a naval mission that rescued would-be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the mediterranean to seek security and a new life in europe .
in the operation 's year-long existence , the italian navy and coastguard had rescued an estimated 100,000 people .
but it proved expensive and politically contentious , and europe was not prepared to help italy shoulder the burden of the crisis .
without european support , the italian government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants .
