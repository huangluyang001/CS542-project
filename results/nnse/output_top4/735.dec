-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's not going to be enough to slake the thirst of the elusive mars bunny , but scientists say new research seems to support the theory that what looks like a bone-dry red planet during the day could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night .
experts have long thought that a particular kind of salt detected in martian soil could pull water vapor from the the planet 's thin atmosphere into the soil at night and then keep it from freezing despite the extreme cold .
researchers are n't saying they 've seen direct evidence of brine hiding out in the martian night .
but they say the new study -- based on a full year of monitoring of temperature and humidity conditions by the mars curiosity rover in gale crater -- does seem to bear the theory out .
