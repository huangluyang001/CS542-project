-lrb- cnn -rrb- north korea is in the headlines again .
according to a wall street journal report thursday , chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads .
and while that number may seem stunning , it is actually only part of a troubling story .
the key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korea 's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country 's weapons capabilities .
