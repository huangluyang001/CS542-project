-lrb- cnn -rrb- duckie 's still got moves .
on tuesday night 's `` late late show '' on cbs , actor jon cryer reprised the character 's record-store dance to otis redding 's `` try a little tenderness , '' right down to the wall-dancing , the counter-bashing and , of course , the trademark white shoes .
in the original scene , one of the best-loved bits from the 1986 john hughes film , cryer dances around a record store , lip-syncing the song as he tries to win the affection of molly ringwald 's andie .
in tuesday 's recreation , he dances in tandem with host james corden , who tweeted that he 'd `` fulfilled a childhood dream '' by re-creating the scene with cryer -- who turned 50 on thursday .
