cedar falls , iowa -lrb- cnn -rrb- as aides politely tried to rush ted cruz from an event in cedar falls to one in cedar rapids , iowa , on thursday , the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him .
finally , after the selfies and conversations started to die down , his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall , burly man stopped him .
`` senator , '' he said , `` can i pray with you real quick ? ''
the past two winners of iowa 's caucuses rose to victory with support from the christian right , and cruz , who announced his bid last month at the well-known baptist school liberty university , is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize .
