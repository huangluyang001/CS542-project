-lrb- cnn -rrb- some fans of lucille ball want her statue removed from a park in her hometown , saying the `` ugly '' likeness does not do justice to the `` i love lucy '' star .
the life-size bronze statue in celoron , new york , has been likened to conway twitty , the snake from `` beetlejuice '' and actor steve buscemi , among other unflattering comparisons .
even mayor scott schrecengost has gone on record saying he does not care for the statue , which shows the comic star holding a bottle of fictional nutrition elixir vitameatavegamin .
and yet , it has been a tourist draw since 2009 for celoron , the comedian 's birthplace , attracting visitors who pose with the statue for pictures .
