-lrb- cnn -rrb- if there was ever any doubt that the obama administration 's clean power plan is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy .
nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon-free electricity .
surely president barack obama 's climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the united states ' overall carbon emissions , would revitalize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets .
well , think again .
