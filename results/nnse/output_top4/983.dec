washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- rick santorum says he 'd hoped indiana gov.
mike pence would veto the `` fix '' to his state 's religious freedom law rather than limiting its scope .
the law unleashed an intense backlash against indiana , led by tech giants like apple and salesforce and sports organizations like the ncaa , amid concerns it would allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers .
santorum , the former republican senator from pennsylvania , who is likely to mount another presidential campaign in 2016 , said on cbs ' `` face the nation '' on sunday that pence 's decision to sign a follow-up bill -- which made clear the law could n't be used to refuse services based on sexual orientation -- led to a `` limited view '' of religious freedom .
