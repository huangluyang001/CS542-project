tehran , iran -lrb- cnn -rrb- there is a persian proverb that says : `` a good year is determined by its spring . ''
for many iranians , the historic decision by tehran and six world powers -- the united states , britain , france , germany , russia and china -- to continue nuclear negotiations under a `` joint comprehensive plan of action '' is an indication that this year 's norouz , the persian new year that started on march 21 , will be a superb one indeed .
it paves the way for a much broader deal by end of june that guarantees the peaceful nature of tehran 's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions and a return to the international community .
as is , the stakes are high and the choice is clear for president hassan rouhani and his `` moderate '' administration .
