-lrb- cnn -rrb- after a weekend shipwreck off the coast of italy that may have killed hundreds of migrants , the international organization for migrants said monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters .
authorities still do n't know the fate of many of the passengers , including children , who were on the large ship bound from libya to europe that capsized saturday night in the frigid waters of the mediterranean sea .
that sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages .
maltese authorities , who are working with italian rescuers , said around 50 people had been saved .
