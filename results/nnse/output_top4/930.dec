as eight of mary jane veloso 's fellow death row inmates -- mostly foreigners , like her -- were put to death by firing squad early wednesday in a wooded grove on the indonesian island of nusa kambangan , the filipina maid and mother of two was spared , at least for now .
veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from malaysia to indonesia when $ 500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage .
supporters , including the filipino advocacy group migrante , and her lawyers claim the young mother was the victim of human trafficking .
cnn philippines reported that veloso 's alleged recruiter , maria kristina sergio , and her partner julius lacanilao surrendered to authorities in the philippines tuesday .
