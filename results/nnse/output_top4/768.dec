-lrb- cnn -rrb- it takes a village to raise a triathlete .
since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full-time triathlete , i 've been juggling training life with a full-time job , hectic commute and time with friends and family .
with my fit nation teammates spread far and wide , this was a solo effort .
throw in a notorious chicago winter that refused to go gently into that good night , and i 'll admit it : i was not very diligent in getting all of my training done .
