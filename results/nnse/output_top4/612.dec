tokyo -lrb- cnn -rrb- with the world watching , in his historic address to a joint session of the u.s. congress , the first ever by a japanese prime minister , shinzo abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history .
during this 70th year anniversary of the end of world war ii , abe has been disappointing on japan 's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for japan 's wartime actions in asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive .
and this `` abenesia '' is harmful to japan 's international image , riles china and south korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda .
washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for abe because the obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with tokyo that contemporary china is a threat requiring a collective response .
