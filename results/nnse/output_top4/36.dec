-lrb- cnn -rrb- after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered .
on its website , the ncaa prominently states , `` it 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed . ''
and later , it says that `` in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second . ''
but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes .
