dongguan , china -lrb- cnn -rrb- for a decade , the new south china mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and china .
opened to the public in 2005 in dongguan in the south of the country , the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment , shops and eateries .
but despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came .
soon , it was classified by industry analysts as a `` dead mall '' and it became an unflattering symbol of china 's runaway speculation on real estate projects .
