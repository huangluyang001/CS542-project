-lrb- cnn -rrb- on thursday , npr -- headquartered in washington , just 40 miles away from baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old freddie gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody .
unfortunately , while it was a freshly produced segment , it was hardly a new story .
titled `` baltimore unrest reveals tensions between african-americans and asians , '' the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal `` what 's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city , '' going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was african-americans `` targeting asian-owned businesses for destruction . ''
but while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year , black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence , there 's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus .
