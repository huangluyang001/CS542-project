washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- president barack obama says he is `` absolutely committed to making sure '' israel maintains a military advantage over iran .
his comments to the new york times , published on sunday , come amid criticism from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu of the deal that the united states and five other world powers struck with iran .
tehran agreed to halt the country 's nuclear ambitions , and in exchange , western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the iran 's economy .
obama said he understands and respects netanyahu 's stance that israel is particularly vulnerable and does n't `` have the luxury of testing these propositions '' in the deal .
