a small group plays with rocks , replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled , while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp .
the shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago , made up of some 4,000 tents and counting .

men faced a choice : convert to islam or be shot .
