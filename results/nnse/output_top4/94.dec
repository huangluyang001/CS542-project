-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` a long , long , time ago ... '' those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of don mclean 's pop masterpiece `` american pie . ''
it 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1/2 minute allegory , which millions of americans know by heart , is 44 years old .
all sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` bye , bye , miss american pie . ''
there is no real way to categorize mclean 's `` american pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock .
