-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world 's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this .
the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two-year shutdown .
after problems that delayed the restart in march , scientists at the european organization for nuclear research -lrb- cern -rrb- completed final tests , enabling the first beams to start circulating sunday inside the lhc 's 17 mile -lrb- 27 km -rrb- ring .
cern says the energies achievable by the lhc have only ever been found in nature .
