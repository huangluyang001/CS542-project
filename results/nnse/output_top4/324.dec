-lrb- cnn -rrb- the american pharmacists association is discouraging its members from participating in executions .
on monday , the group voted at its annual meeting to adopt a ban as an official policy , stating that `` such activities are fundamentally contrary to the role of pharmacists as healthcare providers . ''
this bolsters the association 's previous positions to oppose the use of the term `` drug '' for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases .
the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection , said michelle spinnler , spokeswoman for the american pharmacists association .
