-lrb- cnn -rrb- barney frank , to say the least , knows his way around politics .
in a chicago appearance recently , the retired congressman had the sold-out crowd at the center on halsted well entertained as he detailed his 45-year journey in public service .
frank , you 'll recall , was the first member of congress to marry someone of the same-sex while in office , and among other things , he had some choice words for closeted politicians who vote against lgbt rights .
`` we 're winning , '' he said before joking that the name of the california proposal -- `` the sodomite suppression act '' -- sounded like a porno .
