-lrb- cnn -rrb- some of the men and women of the indianapolis police force are giving up their blues .
beginning friday , blue uniform shirts will be traded for white ones for command staff members of the indianapolis metropolitan police department -lrb- impd -rrb- .
in a statement , the department said the change is being made as part of its constant effort to ensure `` accountability , professionalism and transparency ... at the forefront of our day-to-day activities . ''
as police departments around the country see more protests over the use of lethal force , impd officials acknowledge that this is a time of `` increased scrutiny of police operations and tactics , '' but said the decision to change the uniform for certain ranks within the department is `` not related to any specific , individual incident occurring elsewhere in the united states .
