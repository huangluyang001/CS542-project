washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- the flight voice recorder aboard germanwings flight 9525 reportedly captured blaring cockpit alarms , warning co-pilot andreas lubitz to `` pull up '' and that `` terrain '' was ahead .
but that was not enough to stop the aircraft from slamming into the french alps .
with reports that lubitz apparently ignored those warnings , there are new calls from aviation experts to develop and deploy enhanced crash avoidance software that could take control of an aircraft away from a pilot and steer the plane to a safe altitude .
the technology would work in a fashion similar to crash avoidance technology already used in automobiles .
