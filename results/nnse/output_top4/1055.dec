-lrb- cnn -rrb- the story of anthony stokes was supposed to have a happy ending .
instead it ended tuesday , police say , with the teen heart transplant recipient carjacking someone , burglarizing a home , shooting at an elderly woman , leading police on a high speed chase and then dying after his car hit a pole .
in 2013 , the teen 's family told media that an atlanta hospital rejected him for heart transplant surgery due to what the hospital described in a letter as stokes ' `` history of non-compliance . ''
at the time , mark bell was acting as a stokes family spokesman .
