-lrb- cnn -rrb- noelle velentzas , 28 , could n't understand why u.s. citizens like herself were traveling overseas to wage jihad when they could simply `` make history '' at home by unleashing terrorist attacks , according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed thursday .
velentzas and her former roommate , 31-year-old asia siddiqui , were arrested and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the united states , federal prosecutors said .
siddiqui is also a u.s. citizen .
the complaint paints a picture of a disturbing trend in homegrown violent extremism .
