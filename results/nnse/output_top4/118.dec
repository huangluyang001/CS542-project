-lrb- cnn -rrb- mullah mohammed omar is `` still the leader '' of the taliban 's self-declared islamic emirate of afghanistan .
that appears to be the primary message of a biography , just published by the taliban , of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s .
the taliban 's `` cultural commission '' released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement 's website , ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an april 4 , 1996 , meeting in afghanistan 's kandahar province when an assembly of afghans swore allegiance to omar .
several afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of omar 's demise .
