-lrb- cnn -rrb- i was a copygirl in my fourth month at the chicago daily news , my second assigned to the city desk .
it had become my custom at 4 o'clock , when the city desk secretary left for the day , to move over to her spot to help answer the phones as the beat reporters called in to check out for the day .
it was so quiet that afternoon -- 70 years ago , on thursday , april 12 , 1945 -- the city editor and assistant city editor had felt comfortable leaving their desks .
the second city editor , guy housley , was to my left .
