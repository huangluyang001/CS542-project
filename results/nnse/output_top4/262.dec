-lrb- cnn -rrb- thousands of syrian and palestinian refugees trapped in the yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities .
but while the story is in itself tragic , it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling .
i encountered two such individuals on my mission to damascus -- jihad and mohammad -- tiny , vulnerable infants who were taken from yarmouk in recent days , a place that was described last week by the u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon as `` the deepest circle of hell . ''
the fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children .
