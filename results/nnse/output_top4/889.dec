-lrb- cnn -rrb- a columbia university student who was accused of rape is suing the new york city school for allowing his accuser to publicly brand him a `` serial rapist '' according to the lawsuit , paul nungesser was cleared of responsibility in emma sulkowicz 's 2013 rape claim , as well as others that came to light after sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews .
her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school 's handling of the complaint , saying she hoped to show how `` flawed '' the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases .
the harassment continued , the lawsuit claims , when columbia visual arts professor jon kessler let sulkowicz `` transform her personal vendetta '' into a `` columbia-sponsored calumny '' by supporting `` carry that weight '' for her senior thesis , allowing her to earn school credit through `` this outrageous display of harassment and defamation . ''
bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 new york magazine profile of sulkowicz , now a senior at columbia .
