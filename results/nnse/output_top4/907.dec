-lrb- cnn -rrb- several of the world 's worst terrorist groups , like isis and al-shabaab , aim to create societies governed by strict , distorted versions of sharia law .
that means anyone who does n't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- christians included .
of course , christians are n't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations .
for example , most victims of isis are fellow muslims who refuse to go along with the isis worldview and ruthless tactics .
