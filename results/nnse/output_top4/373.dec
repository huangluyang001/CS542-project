-lrb- cnn -rrb- if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users , would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself ?
the answer , of course , would be no .
yet for decades , many have stood by the belief that such programs , known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs , promote and encourage drug use .
indeed , for congress , it became the rationale behind a ban implemented in 1988 that prohibits the use of federal funds for these programs .
