-lrb- cnn -rrb- fifty years ago in frankfurt , german prosecutors tried 22 former nazi ss soldiers at auschwitz in what remains the most famous holocaust trial staged in germany .
at the time , fritz bauer , the german-jewish attorney general of hessen , expressed the simple hope that `` sooner or later , one of the accused would step forward and say : ` what took place -- it was horrific , i 'm sorry . '
then the entire world would exhale , as would all the survivors of those killed at auschwitz , and the air would be cleared . ''
sadly , bauer observed , `` it has not been uttered , nor will it be . ''
