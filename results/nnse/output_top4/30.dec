-lrb- cnn -rrb- police in the indian city of malegaon , in the western state of maharashtra , are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents : cattle .
following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef , authorities in the city have asked residents to take a ` mugshot ' of their cattle and submit it to the police .
police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law .
cows are considered holy and revered by that state 's majority hindu population .
