sanaa , yemen -lrb- cnn -rrb- as the transport plane comes in to land at sanaa airport , the deep scars of the brutal conflict tearing yemen apart are only too clear : wrecked aircraft line the runway , and nearby buildings lie in ruins .
to most of the outside world , this war-torn country is off limits , the weeks-long battle between houthi rebels and saudi-led coalition forces making it too dangerous to visit , and a no-fly zone rendering its international airport all but obsolete -- but on tuesday , cnn was granted rare access on a desperate aid mission by unicef , the united nations children 's fund .
the airport has previously been bombed .
hostilities are likely to resume before the day is out : a brief , peaceful window has been delicately negotiated following a special request from the u.n. -- but it wo n't last long .
