des moines , iowa -lrb- cnn -rrb- martin o'malley told reporters in iowa on friday that inevitability -- a term bandied about regarding democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton -- is not unbreakable .
`` i 've seen it before , '' the former governor of maryland and possible presidential contender said .
`` history is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable . ''
clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to barack obama .
