-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states is failing its partners .
if you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread , it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat -- and we 're not doing nearly enough to address the problem .
despite this apparent recognition , the united states is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long-term investment in special operations units in key partner nations .
as a result of this neglect , since the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , we have seen deadly terrorist attacks not just in the middle east , but also in indonesia , india and sub-saharan africa .
