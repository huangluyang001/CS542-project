-lrb- cnn -rrb- robert downey jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a british journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie downey was there to promote .
the journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor 's political beliefs and `` dark periods '' of addiction and jail time .
twitter , of course , is abuzz : did journalist krishnan guru-murthy go too far ?
must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he 'd like ?
