-lrb- cnn -rrb- thursday will mark three weeks since saudi arabia began airstrikes on houthi rebels in yemen .
but there is as yet little sign that the rebels are being driven back , that the fighting in yemen is dying down or that lives there are being saved .
to the contrary , increasingly more yemenis appear to be fleeing the country , attempting the dangerous trip in rickety fishing boats across the red sea to the horn of africa -- a trip historically made by people fleeing africa rather than the other way around .
hopes for stability , not only in yemen but in the middle east in general , are fading as fears grow that saudia arabia and iran are fighting a proxy war in yemen for regional domination .
