-lrb- cnn -rrb- sunday 's announcement that corinthian colleges inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable .
corinthian , which once enrolled more than 70,000 students , is one of the worst of the `` predator colleges '' -- schools that offer dubious degrees , saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year .
many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online .
it 's no wonder that corinthian is doing this after the u.s. department of education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer .
