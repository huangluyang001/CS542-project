-lrb- cnn -rrb- if i had to describe the u.s.-iranian relationship in one word it would be `` overmatched . ''
we 're playing checkers on the middle east game board and tehran 's playing three-dimensional chess .
iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices , all the while convincing ourselves that america 's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track .
iran is n't 10 feet tall in this region , but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end-all that is supposed to reduce iran 's power , the united states is only making tehran taller .
