-lrb- cnn -rrb- the white house insists it does n't need congressional approval for the iran nuclear deal announced this month .
but while historical precedent suggests the president might indeed have the authority to move forward without congress , the obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history : getting congress ' signature might be worth the effort .
true , the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy .
