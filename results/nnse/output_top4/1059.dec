-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 've been a chef in some form or another since i was 14 years old , but i did n't become a food activist until much later .
it was 2007 , and a young girl my wife mentored was found rooting through the trash just to find something to eat .
that inspired me to found food policy action and become politically active in a range of food issues , from hunger to factory farms .
of course , i have n't been alone in this work .
