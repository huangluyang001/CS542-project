i see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday americans .
for the first time a majority , 53 % , favor its legalization , with 77 % supporting it for medical purposes .
support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone .
in 1969 , the first time pew asked the question about legalization , only 12 % of the nation was in favor .
