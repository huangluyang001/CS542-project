-lrb- cnn -rrb- on the stage of a tv studio in phnom penh , cambodian-american ly sivhong is telling an engrossed audience a tragic , but familiar , story .
on april 17 , 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as ly knew it was shattered when her hometown , the cambodian capital of phnom penh , fell to the genocidal khmer rouge regime of the communist party of kampuchea .
ly , then 13 , was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who , along with virtually the entire population of phnom penh -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work .
the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the khmer rouge 's revolutionary program of social engineering , intended to establish a new order -- free of money , family ties , religion , education , property and foreign influence .
