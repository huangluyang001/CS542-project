it 's easy to talk of such spirit when paul mccartney is there to honor ringo starr , and yoko ono is on hand as well .
speaking briefly backstage , ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for starr to be honored , `` just sad john and george are n't here , '' referring to her late husband john lennon and beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter george harrison .
starr was certainly happy to be there -- after a long wait , he 's the final beatle to be inducted as a solo act .
`` i 've finally been invited , and i love it , '' said the 74-year-old drummer .
