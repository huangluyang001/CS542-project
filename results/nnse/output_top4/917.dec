-lrb- cnn -rrb- just eight months ago , a young woman named fatu kekula was single-handedly trying to save her ebola-stricken family , donning trash bags to protect herself against the deadly virus .
today , because of a cnn story and the generosity of donors from around the world , kekula wears scrubs bearing the emblem of the emory university nell hodgson woodruff school of nursing in atlanta , where she 's learning skills she can take back home to care for her fellow liberians .
at emory , kekula has asked for special training on certain skills , such as caring for burns , a common type of injury because children in liberia sometimes fall into the open fires used for cooking .
a cnn story about kekula in september prompted donations from around the world to iam , an organization that raises money to help african natives pay for education .
