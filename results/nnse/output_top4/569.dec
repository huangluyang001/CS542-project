the mission , a joint effort between indian air crew and a nepalese army medical team , is only the third operation of its kind to reach the village since saturday 's massive 7.8-magnitude quake , which left more than 5,000 people dead .
the aircraft is stuffed to capacity with tents , medicines and packages of tinned tuna , instant noodles and rice , all bundled haphazardly aboard the mi-17 by soldiers at the air base in kathmandu barely 15 minutes earlier .
according to nepal 's national emergency operation center , 1,376 people were killed in sindhupalchok district , where melamchi is located , when the earthquake hit .
some 18,000 houses were destroyed and 100,000 people have been displaced in the surrounding area , says tamang .
