-lrb- cnn -rrb- saturday 's deadly earthquake in nepal was the `` big one '' experts were waiting for based on the region 's history .
earthquakes are a fact of life in the south asian country , with tremors of magnitude 4 or 5 occurring several times each year , geologist and science journalist kate ravilious said .
with the last major earthquake in 1934 , the concern was not if , but when the next `` great '' earthquake would hit , said ravilious , author of the 2014 article , `` kathmandu 's earthquake nightmare . ''
those fears were realized when a magnitude-7 .8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of kathmandu rocked nepal , toppling homes , historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead , authorities said .
