-lrb- cnn -rrb- a door bearing a graffiti drawing by british artist banksy was seized by police in gaza on thursday after a dispute over its sale , a gaza police official told cnn on thursday .
the owner of the door , rabea darduna , filed a complaint with a gaza court stating that , without realizing its value , he sold the door for just $ 175 u.s. .
the iron door will remain in the possession of the khan younis police in southern gaza until a court hearing at a date yet to be determined .
when darduna 's gaza home was destroyed in last summer 's war , he says he felt he was left with nothing .
