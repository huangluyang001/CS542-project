-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 'm haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police -- his back turned to the officer .
what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while slager appears to plant an item next to his body .
i understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement .
if not for the video taken by a bystander , i ca n't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation .
