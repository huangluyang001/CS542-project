north korean leader kim jong un has backed out of next month 's visit to moscow for world war ii anniversary celebrations , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said thursday .
`` we were informed of the decision via diplomatic channels , '' peskov said .
`` the decision is connected with north korean domestic affairs . ''
the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of north korea in late 2011 .
