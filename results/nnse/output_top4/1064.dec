-lrb- cnn -rrb- back in 1989 , ayatollah khomeini famously said he was `` drinking poison '' when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight-year-old war with iraq .
the war had helped define khomeini 's regime , the islamic republic , which he had founded a year before saddam hussein invaded iran .
khomeini galvanized the nation , both his supporters and growing opponents , to fight against the enemy .
he dragged out the war for eight years , despite saddam 's willingness to accept a ceasefire , and thus stabilized the foundations of the islamic republic .
