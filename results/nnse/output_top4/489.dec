on thursday night 's `` grey 's anatomy , '' dr. derek shepherd -- the hunky character played by patrick dempsey -- died .
he was n't shot down over the sea of japan , nor did a helicopter fall on his head .
instead , he died following a car crash -- after helping victims of another accident .
intriguingly , dempsey still has a year left on his contract .
