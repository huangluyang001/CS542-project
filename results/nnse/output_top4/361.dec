london -lrb- cnn -rrb- a polish prince has challenged populist british politician nigel farage to a duel in london 's hyde park over his immigration policy .
farage , the leader of the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , complains that britain 's membership of the european union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants , many from impoverished eastern europe , into his `` small island '' nation .
in a video posted on youtube , prince jan zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against poles living in britain .
farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of britain 's general elections on may 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince .
