-lrb- cnn -rrb- the third blood moon in a four-part series was the shortest eclipse of the bunch , but still a sweet treat for early risers in north america .
the moon slipped fully into earth 's shadow at 4:58 a.m. pacific time -lrb- 7:58 a.m. et -rrb- saturday , starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what nasa says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century .
the celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before , during and after the total eclipse , giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the `` blood moon '' nickname .
watchers in the eastern half of north america caught only a partial eclipse -- and in some places , an orange one -- before the moon set below the horizon .
