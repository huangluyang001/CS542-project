-lrb- cnn -rrb- the marriage apocalypse may be coming .
talk to any millennial and you can envision an america virtually marriage-free , with everyone happily single .
recently , i talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater , kent state university .
they came to me for career advice , which i gave them , but i also picked their brains about politics , religion and marriage .
