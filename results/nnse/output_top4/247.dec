-lrb- cnn -rrb- the u.n. security council voted tuesday in favor of an arms embargo on houthis -- the minority group that has taken over large swaths of yemen , including its capital , sanaa -- and supporters of former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh .
the resolution `` raises the cost '' for the houthis , according to mark lyall grant , britain 's ambassador to the united nations .
in addition to the arms embargo , it also demands that the shiite group pull back and refrain from more violence and includes sanctions aimed at controlling the spread of terrorism , according to grant .
russia abstained from tuesday 's vote , saying it did n't like the inclusion of sanctions .
