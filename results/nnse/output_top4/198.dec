-lrb- cnn -rrb- danny kahneman , my good friend and co-author who got a nobel prize in economics , once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies .
one group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure ; the other group , which experienced the same type of colonoscopy , did not .
it turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning .
the psychology of it is simple to understand : happy endings matter .
