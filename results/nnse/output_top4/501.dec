-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 've visited nepal at least half a dozen times over the last decade , and of the more than 100 countries that save the children serves , it is undoubtedly one of my favorites .
there are the usual things that are said about it -- the stunning landscape , which includes mount everest , and the amazing food .
but nepal has also made some of the most remarkable progress on maternal and child health in the last few years .
so you can imagine the indescribable sadness i experienced waking up this morning and seeing the news reports that nepal had been hit by its worst earthquake since 1934 , when more than 10,000 people were killed .
