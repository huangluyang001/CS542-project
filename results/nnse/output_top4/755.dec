the biggest challenge standing in the way of eradicating polio has involved the operational logistics of getting the vaccine to people who need it , especially in difficult areas plagued by violence or poverty .

by applying it to the skin and pushing down , the vaccine is delivered in a matter of minutes .
rather than requiring highly trained medics , minimally trained personnel could go from door to door , quickly administering the vaccine .
