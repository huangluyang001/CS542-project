canberra , australia -lrb- cnn -rrb- before `` bali nine '' duo , andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , the last australian executed for drug offenses abroad was van tuong nguyen by singapore in 2005 .
although canberra then , as it is now , was strongly opposed to the death penalty , van 's death did not harm australia 's relationship with singapore , nor the australian people 's view of that country .
the executions of chan and sukumaran early wednesday morning will be a different story .
but the australian public 's view of indonesia , and anger with its government , will take much longer to subside .
