-lrb- cnn -rrb- slamming world powers ' framework nuclear deal with iran , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on friday demanded that any final deal include a `` clear and unambiguous iranian recognition of israel 's right to exist . ''
netanyahu has been perhaps the most vocal critic of nuclear talks with iran , insisting again and again it ca n't be trusted .
he took his case to the u.s. congress last month , at a time before negotiators had hammered out any sort of agreement , over the objections of president barack obama .
there 's never been any dispute about his take , but the prime minister has sharpened his rhetoric in recent days , saying the deal increases the risk of a `` horrific war . ''
