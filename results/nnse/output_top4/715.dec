washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- judge jeffrey sutton does n't have a lot of company on the appeals courts these days .
sutton , who sits on the 6th u.s. circuit court of appeals in cincinnati , penned the only recent appellate court decision to uphold state bans on same-sex marriage .
his opinion , issued in november , goes up against an avalanche of judicial rulings striking down such bans .
the split helped pave the way for the u.s. supreme court to take up a case on tuesday that could ultimately decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have a constitutional right to marry .
