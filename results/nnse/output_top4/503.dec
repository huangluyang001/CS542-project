-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a warm afternoon in miami , and 35-year-old emanuel vega has come to baptist health primary care for a physical exam .
dr. mark caruso shakes his hand with a welcoming smile .
vega , a strapping man with a thick black beard , is feeling good , but he came to see the doctor today because his wife thought he should -- she even made the appointment .
it is free to him under his insurance policy with no co-pay , as most preventive care is under the affordable care act .
