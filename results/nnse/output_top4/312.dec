-lrb- cnn -rrb- the jailing of four blackwater security guards , eight years after they killed 17 iraqi civilians in a shooting in baghdad , is a positive step for justice -- but is also not enough .
the kind of horror represented by the blackwater case and others like it -- from abu ghraib to the massacre at haditha to cia waterboarding -- may be largely absent from public memory in the west these days , but it is being used by the islamic state in iraq and syria -lrb- isis -rrb- to support its sectarian narrative .
in its propaganda , isis has been using abu ghraib and other cases of western abuse to legitimize its current actions in iraq as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant `` sunni resistance '' to `` american aggression '' and to `` shiite betrayal '' -- as phrased in an isis publication from late 2014 titled `` the revived caliphate , '' which chronicles the rise of isis since 2003 .
as the iraqi government today struggles to regain the support of sunnis in its fight against isis -- or even renew intra-sunni trust -- this invocation of american transgressions by isis should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in iraq .
