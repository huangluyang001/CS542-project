kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- the clamor and chaos of the previous day has dissipated by the time we arrive at kathmandu 's only airport .
the mad rush of 24 hours previously , in those first confusing , cacophonous hours following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake near the nepali capital , had died down .
now , families sit , camped out , silent and patiently waiting , but for now abandoned .
at the airport , at passport control , we meet a nepalese man , who is unable to contact his family .
