-lrb- cnn -rrb- when photographer johan bavman became a father for the first time , he took more than a passing wonder about how his native sweden is said to be the most generous nation on earth for parental leave .
get this : sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave , with 390 of them paid at 80 % of income , with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $ 3,474 .
the remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day , or $ 22 .
so to promote both parents to raise their children , sweden has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be `` daddy months '' or `` partner months . ''
