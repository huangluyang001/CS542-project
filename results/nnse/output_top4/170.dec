-lrb- cnn -rrb- what would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $ 100 , or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation ?
these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese-born , american-based jia jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about `` 100 days of rejection '' , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born .
after his tech start-up was declined investment , jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on .
this led to his writing his book called rejection proof , part self-help and part motivational/autobiography , which is being released this week .
