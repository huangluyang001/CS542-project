two african-americans -- ella jones and wesley bell -- were elected to the ferguson city council on tuesday , meaning three of the six council members are black .
this was the first city election since white police officer darren wilson shot and killed unarmed black teenager michael brown last august .
since then , this st. louis suburb of 21,000 people has gone through epic upheaval with revelations of systemic discrimination against african-americans by law enforcement and the courts .
both bell and smith are black , and no matter the outcome , one of them will double the african-american representation on the council .
