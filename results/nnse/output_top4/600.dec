-lrb- cnn -rrb- bernie sanders , my vermont senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president .
he noted at his announcement -lrb- with a familiar note of wise irony -rrb- : `` people should not underestimate me . ''
to most americans , of course , sen. bernie sanders is only a name , if that .
he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation .
