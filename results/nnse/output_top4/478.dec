washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- in 2011 , al qaeda took warren weinstein hostage .
then , about a year later , his family paid money to his captors , said a pakistani source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers .
it did not lead to the american aid worker 's release , and he was inadvertently killed in an anti-terror strike in january , the white house announced thursday .
after the transfer of funds in 2012 , the captors , who never referred to themselves as `` al qaeda , '' but instead as `` afghans , '' began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for weinstein , most prominently dr. aafia siddiqui of pakistan , the source said .
