fallen : nepal 's historic landmarks .
driving through the city , there 's not a huge amount of visible damage . there 's some damage to houses and buildings , but it 's not as visual as the haiti earthquake -lrb- of 2010 -rrb- .
people are beside themselves in shock . their biggest concern now is the structures , needing a place for shelter , to hide from the elements and sleep . food will become the biggest concern in the coming days .
