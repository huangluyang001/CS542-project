-lrb- cnn -rrb- twenty years ago , on april 19 , 1995 , timothy mcveigh detonated a massive truck bomb in front of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city . the attack killed 168 men , women and children , injured hundreds more , and remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in u.s. history .
in other words , right-wing violence today is actually at or very close to levels during the days of the oklahoma city bombing .
