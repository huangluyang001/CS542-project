agyare 's first visit to see the girls -- students at education project achievers ghana -- was in january 2014 . this was supposed to be a one-off seminar as part of her mentorship initiative `` tech needs girls '' -- however , the students proved quite a draw .
this , in part , was why agyare lent her support to achievers ghana .
