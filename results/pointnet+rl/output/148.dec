but last weekend 's raid in the heart of the city 's jewelry district feels like it has been taken from a movie like `` ocean 11 '' given its daring and planning .
such robberies are rare : the gang did n't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in london for more than 40 years . in september 1971 , the staff of a bank in baker street , central london , arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40-yard tunnel from a shop they had rented , hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room . the gang got away with a haul worth around # 30 million -lrb- the incident later formed the basis of the movie `` the bank job . '' -rrb- .
