we take our place on the floor and slowly , the world of camel racing begins to open up to us .
once lunch is over , we head to the track for the racing to begin . there will be 14 races through the afternoon . and in addition to the honor and prestige , the camels are racing for thousands of dollars in prize money and fancy new cars for their owners .
