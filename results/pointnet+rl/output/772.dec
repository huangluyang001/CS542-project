-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton is now officially a candidate for president -- and the never ending clinton story rumbles on . she has been a part of all our lives now for approaching a quarter of a century . she started as the first lady that the right loved to hate , then the deceived wife , next a senator , then a candidate for president in one of the most dynamic primaries in history and finally , a secretary of state .
the republicans have their aristocratic bushes , the democrats have their clintons . and if hillary or jeb were to win two presidential terms , then in the 44 years from 1981 to 2025 , 28 will have had a clinton or a bush in the white house . the great american republic now looks about as democratic as `` game of thrones .
