of course , i have n't been alone in this work . one of the biggest catalysts has been `` the meatrix , '' a 2003 animation parody based on `` the matrix '' and produced by the grace communications foundation , which crystallized the public health risks and environmental harms of factory farming .
in 2014 alone , the biggest meatpackers and their trade groups spent a combined $ 4.3 million on lobbyists . and it has paid off for them : factory farms often avoid penalties for the damage they cause to the environment and public health ; and they receive ridiculous subsidies from the u.s. government that totaled $ 58.7 million in 2012 , according to the environmental working group .
