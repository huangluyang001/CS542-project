the comedian took a fake tumble on the red carpet tuesday night at the 2015 time 100 gala in new york -- right in front of fellow honorees kanye west and kim kardashian , who stepped around her as they moved down the line .
the prank came the same night the third season of schumer 's hit show , `` inside amy schumer , '' premiered on comedy central . the episode has won praise for its `` milk milk lemonade '' video , which ridicules mens ' obsession with a certain female body part , and a `` friday night lights '' parody in which high school football players protest their new coach 's `` no raping '' policy .
