-lrb- cnn -rrb- when i was elected to the kentucky state senate in 1967 , i became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body . five decades later , i find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation .
since coming to the u.s. senate , paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of republican . he 's tried to brand himself as the gop 's minority outreach candidate . the problem for paul , and the gop at large , is that they do n't back up their words with their policies .
