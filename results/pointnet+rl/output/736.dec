-lrb- cnn -rrb- north korea is in the headlines again . according to a wall street journal report thursday , chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads . and while that number may seem stunning , it is actually only part of a troubling story .
true , the reported chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear `` arsenal . '' however , this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by u.s. and other experts .
