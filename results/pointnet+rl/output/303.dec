moscow -lrb- cnn -rrb- joy womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the kremlin ballet theatre , kicking her legs up to her head , jumping and spinning across the room . after class , she eats boiled sweets , one after another -- they are a cheap form of energy .
the dancer , raised in california and texas , left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in russia six years ago , aged 15 , speaking no russian . she studied at the bolshoi ballet academy and was one of the first americans accepted from the school into the company . but in 2013 she left under a cloud -- media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed boshoi official to pay $ 10,000 to dance in even small roles .
