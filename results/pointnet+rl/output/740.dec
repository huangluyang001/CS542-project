-lrb- cnn -rrb- this is a difficult but necessary thing to say : incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed african-americans are unlikely to end soon . that 's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a `` moment . '' and it 's also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it . this is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis .
the peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over . the violent response of police officers to unarmed african-americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as `` race card '' politics and black grievance . but this year 's spate of killings and assaults , from ferguson , missouri , to north charleston , south carolina , to most recently baltimore , are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the african-american community .
