state officials can order people to be killed because -- especially in democracies -- we authorize them to do so .
we can give no more significant power to another human being than to decide who lives or who dies . and yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate -- as is clearly the case in indonesia -- its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this , when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest . less prominent victims of state-sanctioned violence often go entirely unremarked .
