the first step was choosing a bible . i went with the version that i received for winning the religion award at rice memorial high school in south burlington , vermont . as i mentioned in the first installment of this series , i 'm a lifelong catholic who finally plans to read the bible from cover to cover . the bible i 'm reading is `` the deluxe catholic bible , '' published in 1986 by world bible publishing .
