the results of the obama white house 's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical islam in the middle east , north africa and south asia . not to mention here in the united states , canada and europe . is it not a tragic irony that the arab spring-era policies of a nobel peace prize recipient accommodated the transition of syria into the world 's newest jihad theater while leaving libya a failed state and yemen a failing state ?
the syrian jihad gave rise to the islamic state in iraq and syria , which now uses syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in iraq , which could soon spill over into jordan . plus , libya is now being used as a rear operating base by isis and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the middle east , even as they plan attacks in europe and north america .
