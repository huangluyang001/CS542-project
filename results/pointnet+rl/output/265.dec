this sunday in rome , pope francis faced just such a dilemma .
a slew of historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a `` genocide . '' -lrb- a u.s. resolution to do the same has languished in congress . -rrb- turkish officials disagree , arguing that the deaths , while unfortunate , were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides .
`` hatred '' and `` animosity '' are not words often used to describe pope francis .
