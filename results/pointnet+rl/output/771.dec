washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's the mistake that hillary clinton wo n't make again : ignoring her gender .
clinton often says there 's no better time in history to be born female than the present . she 's now betting that there is no better time for her to make history as the nation 's first woman president .
clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics .
