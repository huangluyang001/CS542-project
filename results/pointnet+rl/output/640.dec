lewis hamilton took victory for the silver arrows at the chinese grand prix -- only for his teammate nico rosberg to later claim he had ruined his race by driving slowly .
hamilton had lost the malaysia grand prix in a strategic battle with the ferrari of sebastian vettel but it was business as usual in shanghai .
vettel is just 13 points behind hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of rosberg , after the first three races of the year .
