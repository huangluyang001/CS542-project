the attack at a university in garissa on thursday killed 147 people , mostly students . the al-shabaab militant group claimed responsibility .
it was the deadliest attack in the nation since al qaeda killed more than 200 people at the u.s. embassy in nairobi in 1998 .
kenya launched airstrikes monday targeting al-shabaab 's training camps in somalia , according to a military source , adding that the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at the university .
