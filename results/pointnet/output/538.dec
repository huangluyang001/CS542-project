-lrb- cnn -rrb- nine of ten mostly foreign prisoners on death row in indonesia have been given 72 hours notice ahead of their execution , according to a spokesperson for the attorney general 's office .
`` seventy-two hours notification means three days , at least , to go to the execution .
it may be longer .
in other words , there will be no execution less than 72 hours after notification , '' tony spontana told cnn by phone sunday .
though indonesian officials said all 10 would be executed at the same time , spontana said french national serge atlaoui had filed a challenge to the state administrative court on thursday so his sentence has been delayed .
