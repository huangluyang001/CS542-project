i encountered two such individuals on my mission to damascus -- jihad and mohammad -- tiny , vulnerable infants who were taken from yarmouk in recent days , a place that was described last week by the u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon as `` the deepest circle of hell . ''
the fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children .
looking into those bright young faces , touching their pristine hands , the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me .
