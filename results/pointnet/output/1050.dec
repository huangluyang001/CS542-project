-lrb- cnn -rrb- anthony ray hinton is 58 years old .
until one week ago , when his murder convictions were wiped clean , and hinton walked out of a county jail in birmingham .
hinton had to get used to much worse .
for 30 years , he spent most of his time locked in a 5-by-7 cell .
there was no going outside at night .
the only permissible eating utensil was a plastic spoon .
and life in the outside world passed him by : hinton said his hardest day came in 2002 , when he learned his mother had died .
