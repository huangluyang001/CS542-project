the special forces were on the ground in noncombat roles `` coordinating and guiding '' the battle against houthi forces and fighters loyal to former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh , the source said .
they also have helped parachute in weapons and communications equipment .
houthi rebels , meanwhile , withdrew from the presidential palace and other key parts of the southern port city of aden following heavy saudi airstrikes , according to the source .
the withdrawal signaled a reversal from rebel gains the previous day , when houthi forces seized the presidential palace .
president abdu rabu mansour hadi , who fled the country last month , had stayed for a period of time after houthis secured control of the capital , sanaa , in january .
