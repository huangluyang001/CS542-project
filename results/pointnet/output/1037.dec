according to afp , the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed muslims to leave .
this would be consistent with the past practices of al-shabaab , the somalia-based terror group that 's claimed responsibility for the attack .
that 's what al-shabaab did in a december raid on a quarry in the kenyan village of kormey , near the somali border , that ended with at least 36 killed .
