for tehran and its regional allies -- including the houthi movement in yemen -- saudi arabia 's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable .
and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war .
and yet despite rouhani 's open pledge , profound differences over syria and iraq in particular have kept riyadh and tehran apart .
but if the questions of syria and iraq prevented a pause in hostilities , the saudi military intervention in yemen since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels .
unlike in syria and in iraq , the saudi military is now directly battling it out with iranian-backed rebels in yemen .
