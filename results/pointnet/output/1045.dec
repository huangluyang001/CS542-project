he has identified valery spiridonov as the first patient .
the 30-year-old russian man suffers from a rare genetic disorder called werdnig-hoffman disease .
canavero says the man volunteered .
the two men have talked via skype but they have yet to meet in person and canavero has not reviewed spiridonov 's medical records .
another big obstacle is the need for a partner .
canavero ca n't just do this in his own frankenstein lab .
he needs a major academic medical center to host this endeavor and he has his eyes set on the united states .
he hopes to get a buy-in this summer when he presents his plan to the american academy of neurological and orthopedic surgeons , or aanos , at its annual conference in june .
he 's counting on getting the green light he needs for the first human whole head transplant to take place in 2017 .
