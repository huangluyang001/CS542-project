as hillary clinton prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month , she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality .
former maryland gov.
martin o'malley , who is also running for the democratic nomination , is trying to steal clinton 's thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth .
in other words , there are many signs that democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality .
but in other recent news , the likelihood that new york 's chuck schumer will replace harry reid as leader of the senate democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality .
while schumer has been a very effective democrat and skilled legislative leader , he is also a wall street democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state .
