-lrb- cnn -rrb- back in 1989 , ayatollah khomeini famously said he was `` drinking poison '' when he accepted a ceasefire to end the eight-year-old war with iraq .
the war had helped define khomeini 's regime , the islamic republic , which he had founded a year before saddam hussein invaded iran .
khomeini galvanized the nation , both his supporters and growing opponents , to fight against the enemy .
since then , `` drinking a chalice of poison '' has became part of iranian political lexicon , and many analysts have asked whether ayatollah ali khamenei , khomeini 's successor , would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the west to end iran 's nuclear program .
