for many iranians , the historic decision by tehran and six world powers -- the united states , britain , france , germany , russia and china -- to continue nuclear negotiations under a `` joint comprehensive plan of action '' is an indication that this year 's norouz , the persian new year that started on march 21 , will be a superb one indeed .
they must now be over the moon : in early 2016 , there will be legislative and assembly of experts elections , the latter of which elects the country 's leader .
this historic agreement will make sure they win both the elections .
