here 's the announcement presidential candidate hillary clinton should make : .
`` today in america , women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn .
and the gap is even greater for women of color .
that 's unconscionable .
as president , my top priority will be fixing inequality and ensuring that 100 % of the population is paid 100 % of what they 're worth .
and so , i 'm announcing that if elected president , i will take a 23 % pay cut , equivalent to the current gender wage gap , to stand in solidarity with working women in america .
and i wo n't take a raise until every woman in america gets a raise , too . ''
