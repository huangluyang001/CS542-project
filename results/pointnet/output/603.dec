i was at my uncle 's place in ramkot , west kathmandu , some 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.4 miles -rrb- east from my family home .
a high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field .
a mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider .
