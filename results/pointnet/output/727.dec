rome -lrb- cnn -rrb- a destination for the destitute , sicily is the `` promised land '' for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from north africa to europe 's mediterranean coast .
more than 10,000 people have arrived from libya since last weekend alone , according to the italian coast guard .
stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between north africa and italy ; boat people have been arriving on italy 's islands for more than a decade .
in 2008 , the-then italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and gadhafi signed an historic friendship agreement in which italy promised to invest $ 5 billion in libyan infrastructure and gadhafi promised to close what he described as a `` spigot '' of migrants .
during a three-day state visit to italy in august 2010 , he famously threatened to `` turn europe black '' if libya did not enjoy cordial relations with the european union .
