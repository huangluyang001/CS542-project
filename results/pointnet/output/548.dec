boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- sending boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev to prison for the rest of his life would bring years of punishment and rob him of martyrdom , jurors were told monday .
bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from : death , or life in prison without any possibility of parole .
tsarnaev , 21 , was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him ; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- krystle campbell , 29 ; lingzi lu , 23 ; martin richard , 8 ; and sean collier , 26 .
