the boot was next to his left stump , he testified before a federal jury thursday , the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the boston marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for dzhokhar tsarnaev .
the prosecution rested thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless .
the defense , led by famed death penalty opponent judy clarke , is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain tsarnaev 's difficult upbringing .
clarke will begin those efforts monday .
the jury must decide whether the 21-year-old , who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother , will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison .
