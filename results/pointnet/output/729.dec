essawi , the deputy head of the anbar provincial council , told cnn from inside the city wednesday that it 's unclear how much longer government troops can hold their front lines against the isis offensive .

according to the anbar official , at least 10 iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against isis on wednesday .
