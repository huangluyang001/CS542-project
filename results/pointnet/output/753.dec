although a `` no-fly zone '' over the white house has long existed , the sfra airspace was developed to protect the washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
the size of the sfra airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it , an opportunity to identify the threat , and if necessary , to divert or eliminate it .
an airspeed restriction begins at a 60-mile radius from the center of reagan national airport .
at the 30-mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code -lrb- a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight -rrb- .
aircraft must enter the sfra through specific flight `` gates '' that are displayed on a standard aviation map .
