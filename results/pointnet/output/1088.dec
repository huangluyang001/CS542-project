tsarnaeva is the sister of dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev .
authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 boston marathon bombing , which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured .
police shot and killed tamerlan tsarnaev , 26 , during the manhunt and later captured dzhokhar , who is now on trial .
tsarnaev 's lawyers do n't dispute that he did it .
the defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older , self-radicalized brother to commit acts of terror .
the tsarnaev family first immigrated to the boston area back in 2002 .
the parents , fleeing a troubled region of russia , were treated as legal residents and granted asylum -- a status that opened the door for taxpayer-funded welfare .
