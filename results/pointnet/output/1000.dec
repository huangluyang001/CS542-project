-lrb- cnn -rrb- indiana 's controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately .
after a firestorm of backlash and protests , gov.
mike pence said on tuesday that the state will `` fix '' the religious freedom restoration act , or rfra , so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians .
pence is making the right call .
promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one .
not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the lgbt community .
if people of good will come together , liberty and equality can both be saved .
