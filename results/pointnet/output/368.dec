-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 've been in disaster management long enough to know that there is really no one right way to mark the anniversary of a tragic event .
as the boston marathon runners begin and , hopefully , finish their exhausting run monday , the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways .
with the luxury of some time and healing , the city has moved on .
and that is a blessing .
in the midst of that weeklong tragedy -- the bombings , the manhunt , the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the tsarnaev brothers -- we thought we knew what was going on .
but we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness , the fog of war .
sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions .
