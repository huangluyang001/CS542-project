-lrb- cnn -rrb- if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users , would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself ?
the answer , of course , would be no .
yet for decades , many have stood by the belief that such programs , known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs , promote and encourage drug use .
indeed , for congress , it became the rationale behind a ban implemented in 1988 that prohibits the use of federal funds for these programs .
as a result of the recent spikes in hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in rural indiana and kentucky , the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore again .
and this time , scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread of these two blood-borne diseases that can be spread by contaminated syringes .
this is a welcome step -- an estimated 50,000 americans are newly infected with hiv every year , and some 8 % are among injection drug users .
meanwhile , between 2006 and 2012 , at least 30 states experienced increases in hepatitis c infection rates , with more than half reporting at least a 200 % increase in acute infections among young adults .
overall , the prevalence of acute hepatitis c among people under 30 rose from 36 % to 49 % in six years .
