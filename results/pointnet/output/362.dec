italy boasts the highest number of unesco world heritage sites in the world -- 50 , several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources .
and there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides , floods and natural calamities .
the unesco-listed basilica of assisi , where st. frances ' tomb lies , is just the last of a series of national shames .
its frescoed walls by renaissance masters including giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle .
in a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros .
we 're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value .
