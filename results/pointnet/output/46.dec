-lrb- cnn -rrb- president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president .
reaching a good , solid agreement with iran is a worthy , desirable goal .
but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening america 's hand and strengthening iran .
the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b. few believe it , particularly in the middle east and notably among america 's arab friends , who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed obama .
