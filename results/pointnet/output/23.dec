-lrb- cnn -rrb- sky watchers in western north america are in for a treat : a nearly five-minute total lunar eclipse this morning .
it started at 3:16 a.m. pacific daylight time , when the moon began moving into earth 's shadow .
for the next hour and 45 minutes , that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. pacific time .
the total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds , and nasa says that makes it the shortest one of the century .
