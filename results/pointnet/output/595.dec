dzhokhar `` jahar '' tsarnaev 's defense team is seeking to spare him from a death sentence for his part two years ago in the boston marathon bombings and murder of an mit police officer .
having focused on his dead older brother , portraying tamerlan tsarnav as harsh , overbearing and bent on jihad , they now shift to the younger brother who tagged after him , as one witness said , `` like a puppy . ''
the sentencing phase of the federal case will resume monday .
the jury was sent home thursday because a juror was sick .
tsarnaev was convicted april 8 on all 30 counts , including 17 that carry a possible death penalty .
