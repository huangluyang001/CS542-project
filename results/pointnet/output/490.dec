his own attorney , james sultan , admitted that hernandez `` witnessed '' the killing of odin lloyd , `` committed by somebody he knew , '' but said his client did not commit the crime .
even before the guilty verdict came down wednesday , for many -- at least those covering the trial -- audacity seemed to be the defendant 's biggest crime .
`` the arrogance of aaron hernandez , '' a new yorker headline accused .
i do n't get it .
what does it matter that hernandez was arrogant in court , or walked with too much swagger , or even smiled at his girl ?
like it or not , that is who he is .
the evidence is what matters .
and for once , this time it appears the jury carefully considered the damning mountain of circumstantial evidence against this defendant and came to the right decision : guilty of first-degree murder in the 2013 slaying of odin lloyd .
hernandez , 25 , was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole .
he was also found guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition .
