thale 's job normally requires him to walk the streets of the city he has called home for the past few years .
the cause of this surge in violence is murky , with some blaming alleged inflammatory comments about foreign nationals from the zulu king , local media reported , others saying a labor dispute between locals and foreigners back in march turned nasty .
unemployment in impoverished areas has also been a factor .
the violence has caused thousands of immigrants to seek refuge at police stations and shelters .
