iran is n't 10 feet tall in this region , but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end-all that is supposed to reduce iran 's power , the united states is only making tehran taller .
consider the following : .
the u.s.-iranian relationship is not symmetrical .
it 's not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors .
iran is about to try a u.s. citizen and washington post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest , we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from iran 's serial abuse of human rights , including the behavior of its shia militias in iraq .
i can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind-the-scenes plan to have iran release jason rezaian .
