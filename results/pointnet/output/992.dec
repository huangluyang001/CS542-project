but the blood of 147 people slaughtered and 79 more injured , when al-shabaab opened fire at a college campus in garissa on thursday , has them debating them with renewed vigor .
many kenyans had believed that security improved enough since al-shabaab held nairobi 's westgate mall under siege for four days in september 2013 , resulting in the deaths of 67 people .

with the highest death toll since the 1998 al qaeda bombing on the u.s. embassy in nairobi , many are saying security is still not tight enough .
