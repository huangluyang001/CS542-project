she invited several other women , including complete newbies , through the soletri sisters facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes , bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes .
that was great motivation to keep up with my workouts for the next week .
a few weeks later , i traveled to little rock , arkansas , to run a marathon .
i traveled to little rock with three phenomenal `` fitspirations '' : samantha goga , natali villarruel and umber rahman -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the midwest vikings .
seeing how much fun they 've had participating in some really daunting physical challenges helped me push through some of the more difficult moments of running my first marathon !
