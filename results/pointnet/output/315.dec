that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris .
bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead .
but it 's happened before .
in a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california .
the former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead .
mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct .
