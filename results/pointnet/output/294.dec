the shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago , made up of some 4,000 tents and counting .
the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of sinjar , which is near the border with syrian kurdistan , and fled the isis assault there back in august .
but not everyone escaped .
isis took thousands of yazidis captive .
the fighters separated the young women and girls , some as young as 8 years old , to be sold as slaves , for their `` masters '' to use as concubines .
men faced a choice : convert to islam or be shot .
