his wife said she was still searching for answers thursday after u.s. officials revealed the 73-year-old american aid worker had been accidentally killed in a u.s. drone strike targeting al qaeda .
`` we were so hopeful that those in the u.s. and pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so , and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through , '' elaine weinstein said in a statement .
`` we do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding warren 's death , but we do understand that the u.s. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances . ''
gunmen abducted weinstein in 2011 from his home in lahore , parkistan .
they posed as neighbors , offered food and then pistol-whipped the american aid worker and tied up his guards , his family said .
