-lrb- cnn -rrb- fifty years ago in frankfurt , german prosecutors tried 22 former nazi ss soldiers at auschwitz in what remains the most famous holocaust trial staged in germany .
the refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of holocaust trials .
john demjanjuk , whose conviction by a munich court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of oskar gr√∂ning , remained defiantly silent during his 18-month trial , never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse .
over the years , some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations , but have insisted that they played no role .
those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb .
