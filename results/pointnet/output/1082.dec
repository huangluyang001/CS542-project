-lrb- cnn -rrb- the leader of yemen 's houthi rebels vowed not to back down on sunday as a top saudi military official claimed weeks of airstrikes had significantly weakened the shiite group .
his comments came after more than three weeks of saudi-led coalition bombings aimed at pushing back the houthis , who surged into the capital of sanaa in january and ousted president abdu rabu mansour hadi from power .
hadi still claims he 's yemen 's legitimate leader and is working with the saudis and other allies to return to his country .
since mid-march , more than 700 people have been killed in violence that shows no sign of slowing , according to figures from the world health organization .
