that was the message friday from attorney general eric holder to members of the u.s. justice department , which includes the fbi , u.s. marshals service , bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives and other agencies .
`` the solicitation of prostitution threatens the core mission of the department , '' holder wrote in a memo to all personnel in the department he heads . ''
... regardless of whether prostitution is legal or tolerated in a particular jurisdiction , soliciting prostitutes creates a greater demand for human trafficking and a consequent increase in the number of minor and adult persons trafficked into commercial sex slavery . ''
