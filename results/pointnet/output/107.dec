luckily , katie -- a giraffe at the dallas zoo -- is a champ .
in an hour-long labor captured by 10 cameras and streamed live by animal planet , katie gave birth to a not-so-little baby -lrb- about 6 feet tall -rrb- early friday evening .
there was no immediate word on the newborn 's gender or condition .
but there were good signs , as seen on the live stream and dallas zoo 's twitter feed -- like its ears moving , its efforts to stand , and its nursing -lrb- or at least trying to nurse -rrb- from mom .
