the previous round of talks between houthi rebels and the government of yemeni president abdu rabu mansour hadi failed in january after rebels attacked the president 's personal residence and presidential palace in sanaa , the yemeni capital .
but less than 24 hours later , after rebel forces attacked a yemeni government military brigade , the airstrikes resumed , according to security sources in taiz .
five airstrikes targeted a weapons depot in the province late wednesday , two taiz security officials said .
explosions lasted for about 40 minutes , they said .
