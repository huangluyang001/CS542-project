in a crowded reception before a memorial concert in istanbul this week , people rushed to greet fethiye cetin .
a strong , soft-spoken woman now in her 60s , cetin is a prominent lawyer who represented armenian-turkish journalist hrant dink .
dink was a strong proponent of reconciliation between turks and armenians who was tried for `` insulting turkishness . ''
he was assassinated in 2007 .
the shocking discovery of her true heritage would change cetin 's life .
she tells heranus ' story in an evocative memoir titled `` my grandmother . ''
heranus and her family were among a massive stream of women and children being forcibly marched by ottoman soldiers , not knowing where they were going or why they were torn away from their male relatives .
echoing throughout the procession were morbid whispers that the men and teenage boys had all been killed .
