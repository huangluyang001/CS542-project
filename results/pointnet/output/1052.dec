marsh first named the brontosaurus in 1879 , after he received 25 crates of bones discovered at como bluff , wyoming , according to the yale peabody museum of natural history .
similar to , though not as large as the apatosaurus discovered a couple of years prior , marsh named the dinosaur , `` brontosaurus , '' or `` thunder lizard . ''
apatosaurus had three sacral vertebrae in its hip region and brontosaurus had five , according to the museum 's website , so marsh gave the dinosaurs two different names .
later it was discovered that the number of sacral vertebrae is related to age : as the animal gets older , two of the vertebrae fuse to the sacrum .
