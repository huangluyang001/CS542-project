corinthian , which once enrolled more than 70,000 students , is one of the worst of the `` predator colleges '' -- schools that offer dubious degrees , saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year .
many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online .
it 's no wonder that corinthian is doing this after the u.s. department of education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer .
there are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges , many of which have questionable track records , and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools .
with uncle sam 's student loan debt sheet topping $ 1 trillion , we literally ca n't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86 % of their funding from federal student loan money .
