there were torrential rainstorms for a couple of hours , and with the strong aftershock a couple of hours ago , no one wants to go inside .
the residents of kathmandu sure do n't .
you can see some structural damage to buildings .
most buildings are not up to high construction standards .
driving through the city , there 's not a huge amount of visible damage .
there 's some damage to houses and buildings , but it 's not as visual as the haiti earthquake -lrb- of 2010 -rrb- .
