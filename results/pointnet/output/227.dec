-lrb- cnn -rrb- the white house insists it does n't need congressional approval for the iran nuclear deal announced this month .
but while historical precedent suggests the president might indeed have the authority to move forward without congress , the obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history : getting congress ' signature might be worth the effort .
the president and his advisers have avoided using the term `` treaty , '' instead explaining that it would be a `` nonbinding agreement . ''
according to secretary of state john kerry : `` we 've been very clear from the beginning .
we 're not negotiating a ` legally binding plan . '
we 're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement . ''
on `` meet the press , '' kerry said , `` what we 're looking for is not to have congress interfere with our ability , inappropriately , by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the president . ''
