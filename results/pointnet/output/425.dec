the whale , named varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles -lrb- 22,500 kilometers -rrb- , according to a release from oregon state university , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study .
varvara , which is russian for `` barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off russia 's sakhalin island to cross the pacific ocean and down the west coast of the united states to baja , mexico .
varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the guinness worlds records website .
it said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the arctic and antarctic regions . ''
