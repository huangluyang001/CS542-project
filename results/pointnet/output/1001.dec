in light of the tragic massacre of christian college students in kenya on thursday , and the ongoing threat against christians in other nations , this holy week we are calling upon christians to also reflect upon the crucifixion , beheading , stoning , enforced slavery , sexual abuse , human trafficking , harassment , bombing and displacement of hundreds of thousands of christians -- and others -- whose faith alone has made them a target of religious extremists .
countless lives have been utterly destroyed in nations such as iraq , syria , libya , pakistan , india , egypt , kenya and nigeria .
