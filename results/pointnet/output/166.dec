-lrb- cnn -rrb- one year after it was perpetrated , the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend : hundreds of teenaged girls , just finishing school , destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped , never to be seen again .
`` this crime has rightly caused outrage both in nigeria and across the world , '' the country 's president-elect , muhammadu buhari , said tuesday in marking the anniversary .
`` today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims , their friends and families .
our thoughts and prayers , and that of the whole nigerian nation , are with you today . ''
the girls were abducted on the night of april 14-15 , 2014 , in the town of chibok , in northeastern nigeria , about a two-hour drive from the border with cameroon .
