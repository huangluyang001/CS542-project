-lrb- billboard -rrb- the key to rock 's longevity is it never defines itself into irrelevance .
so while there were some loud , dirty guitars at the 2015 rock and roll hall of fame induction ceremony in cleveland on saturday night , there was as much recognition for rock 's antecedents in soul and blues , speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that 's beyond words .
it 's easy to talk of such spirit when paul mccartney is there to honor ringo starr , and yoko ono is on hand as well .
speaking briefly backstage , ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for starr to be honored , `` just sad john and george are n't here , '' referring to her late husband john lennon and beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter george harrison .
starr was certainly happy to be there -- after a long wait , he 's the final beatle to be inducted as a solo act .
