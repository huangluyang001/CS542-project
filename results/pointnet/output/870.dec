we boarded the finance police 's ship , the calabrese , in lampedusa harbor earlier in the evening .
the calabrese regularly patrols the mediterranean off lampedusa , which is italy 's southernmost territory and just 70 miles , or just over 110 kilometers , from the tunisian coast .
in recent years , it has been the first point of entry to europe for tens of thousands of migrants from africa and the middle east .
a few years ago , the calabrese was on the look out for `` contrabandisti , '' smugglers trafficking in cigarettes and drugs .
but in recent years , its 12-man crew has joined italy 's effort to rescue migrants coming from africa and the middle east .
