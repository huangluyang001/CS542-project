atlanta -lrb- cnn -rrb- federal marshals have arrested scott kelley , a fugitive accused of kidnapping who was featured on cnn 's `` the hunt . ''
kelley , 50 , was taken into custody at the atlanta airport wednesday after arriving on a flight from costa rica , deputy u.s. marshal jamie berry said .
kelley has been wanted since 2004 , accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution .
his wife , genevieve kelley , who 's charged with the same crimes , turned herself in to authorities last year , just a few months after the case was featured on cnn 's `` the hunt . ''
her trial is scheduled to start next month .
