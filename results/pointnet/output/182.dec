-lrb- cnn -rrb- last month wu rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on international women 's day against sexual harassment in china .
since then , the chinese authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for `` creating disturbances . ''
they also briefly detained some of the activists ' supporters , raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release , and have at points denied some of the women access to medical treatment , lawyers and adequate rest .
the fate of the five will be revealed by april 13 , as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or `` formally arrested , '' which almost always leads to conviction in china 's legal system .
