garissa , kenya -lrb- cnn -rrb- days after a horrific al-shabaab attack on its soil , kenya launched airstrikes targeting the terror group in somalia , according to a military source , who insisted the strikes were not retribution for last week 's massacre at garissa university college that killed nearly 150 people .
`` the latest attack of al-shabaab bases by the kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011 .
it is not a retaliation to the garissa attack .
the operation has been ongoing , '' the military source said monday .
two of the airstrikes hit al-shabaab training camps , according to a resident of the southwest somalian town of bardera , almost 200 kilometers -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- from the kenyan border , and a local journalist who asked not to be named out of fear for his safety .
