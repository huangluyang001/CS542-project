-lrb- cnn -rrb- u.s. president barack obama 's recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the middle east is far from reassuring to the region .
in his interview with tom friedman from the new york times on april 4 , obama explained u.s. foreign policy moves on iran and cuba , which friedman described as the `` obama doctrine . ''
he stated that `` we will engage , but we preserve all our capabilities . ''
by capabilities , the president must mean the tools , whether diplomatic , economic or military , to protect and defend u.s. interests .
