but walker 's death in november 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the `` fast and furious '' film franchise .
the release of `` furious 7 '' on friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in hollywood .
the actor was on break from filming `` furious 7 '' at the time of the fiery accident , which also claimed the life of the car 's driver , roger rodas .
producers said early on that they would not kill off walker 's character , brian o'connor , a former cop turned road racer .
