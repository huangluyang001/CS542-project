catania , sicily -lrb- cnn -rrb- we are at the beginning of a massive and mounting crisis with no solution in sight .

the migrant crisis that has suddenly drawn hundreds of journalists to sicily has been brewing for years , but in the past 10 days , with as many as 1,600 deaths in the mediterranean , suddenly minds are focused -- for now .
it was late at night in the besieged city of misrata .
hundreds of african migrants were caught between the libyan civil war -lrb- back then some optimistically called it a `` revolution '' -rrb- and the deep blue sea .
they had come to misrata from ghana , nigeria and elsewhere , hoping to board rickety boats to cross the sea to europe .
