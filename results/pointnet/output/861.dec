-lrb- cnn -rrb- in 1944 , 16-year-old yong soo lee of taegu , korea , was lured by a friend of hers to meet with an older japanese man .
the man took the two of them , and three other teenage girls , by train , then ship , to taiwan .
there , the girls were forced into sexual slavery , serving four to five japanese soldiers every day for a year .
lee suffered beatings and torture , was infected with a venereal disease , was fed paltry amounts of food , faced temperatures so cold that ice formed on her body , and was never allowed outside .
only the end of world war ii brought her relief .
lee is just one example of the over 200,000 women from korea , china , the philippines , indonesia , and other asian nations , who were kidnapped and sexually enslaved by the japanese imperial army during world war ii .
these so-called `` comfort women '' suffered unimaginable physical , emotional , and psychological trauma .
