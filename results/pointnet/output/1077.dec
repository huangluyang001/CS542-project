-lrb- cnn -rrb- the investigation into the crash of germanwings flight 9525 has not revealed evidence of the co-pilot andreas lubitz 's motive , but he suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf , germany , said monday .
it is believed that lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane tuesday into the french alps , killing all 150 on board .
in short , investigators in germany and france are not yet ruling anything out .
