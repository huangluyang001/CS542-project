for centuries , these plays and three dozen more by william shakespeare have formed history 's most heralded literary canon .
new research indicates that `` double falsehood , '' a play first published in 1728 by lewis theobald , was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher .
the findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the `` newer '' play .
