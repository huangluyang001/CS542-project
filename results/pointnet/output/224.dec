-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton 's campaign-in-waiting met on saturday in its brooklyn headquarters , a day before the former secretary of state officially announces her campaign for president , according to a democrat who attended the meeting .
robby mook , clinton 's soon-to-be campaign manager , distributed a `` values statement '' at the meeting that outlined what the campaign will stand for , what their goals are and how they plan to win -- something clinton failed to do in 2008 .
