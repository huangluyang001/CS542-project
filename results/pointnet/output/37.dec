the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world , is ready for action following a two-year shutdown .
the lhc generates up to 600 million particles per second , with a beam circulating for 10 hours , traveling more than 6 billion miles -lrb- more than 10 billion kilometers -rrb- -- the distance from earth to neptune and back again .
at near light-speed , a proton in the lhc makes 11,245 circuits per second .
