-lrb- cnn -rrb- the justices of the supreme court practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same-sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday .
of course , the constitution has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same-sex marriage as justice antonin scalia .
to originalists like scalia -- those who believe the constitution should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage is anathema .
