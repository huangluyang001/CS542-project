-lrb- cnn -rrb- this week , hillary clinton surprised the world yet again -- not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it .
she sure pushed the envelope .
with her video , new logo and road trip , she opened a long communications campaign not only to `` rebrand '' herself but to completely reframe who she is , what she stands for and how she intends to run .
ruth marcus -- a columnist for the washington post -- dismissed her launch video as a `` relentlessly , insultingly vapid '' effort of `` demographic box-checking . ''
jon stewart lampooned it as a `` state farm commercial gone viral '' and also `` boring as s -- . ''
since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for hillary , their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter 's eyes .
