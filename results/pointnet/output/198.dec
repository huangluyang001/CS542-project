let 's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average american , `` stuff '' happens -lrb- keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running -rrb- , paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck .
but recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 american taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes , and the average amount is close to $ 3000 .
that pays for a lot of stuff .
to make the good news even better , tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people , with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free .
no filing headaches and a check to boot .
what 's not to like ?
but now is not the time to explain such serious matters ; the people are too busy spending their refunds .
