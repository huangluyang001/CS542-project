the nigerian city is among african metropolises which have seen some of the highest growth in the number of millionaires on the continent .
others include luanda , dar es salaam and accra , which is predicted to nearly double its millionaire count from 800 in 2012 to 1,500 in 2020 .
if the growth continues , these cities could join an existing club of african wealth hubs hosting the so-called ultra-high net worth individuals , typically those with over $ 30 million of net assets excluding their primary residence .
these centers of affluence are spread from johannesburg in the south , through lagos in the west and nairobi in the east , to cairo in the north .
