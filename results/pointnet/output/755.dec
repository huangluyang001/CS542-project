it 's been 60 years since a mass inoculation of jonas salk 's vaccine began with school children in april , 1955 that caused polio cases in the united states to drop by almost 90 % over the course of two years .
the vaccine was eagerly awaited because , according to the cdc , about 35,000 people annually became disabled because of polio in the u.s. in the 1940s and '50s .
in 1938 , roosevelt founded the national foundation for infantile paralysis , an organization known today as the march of dimes foundation , to fight polio .
the organization funded the two vaccines -- one created by salk and another by albert sabin -- that would lead to the protection of most of the world against polio .
