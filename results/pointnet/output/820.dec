if you 're young -- say , under 35 -- this may not be news to you .
fireball , which did n't exist in its current form a decade ago , is the fastest-growing big brand of liquor in america .
retail sales more than doubled last year , and fireball has come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixth-most popular liquor brand in the u.s. as measured by retail sales -- ahead of such venerable labels as jim beam , jose cuervo and grey goose .
and these figures do n't include sales in bars , where fireball has dethroned jagermeister as america 's party shot of choice .
or social media feeds , which fill with photos of fireball-flavored revelry and #fireballfriday hashtags .
