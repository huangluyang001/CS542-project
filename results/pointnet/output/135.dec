a 2012 small arms survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide .
according to the united nations , two women are killed there every day .
some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict , most of them from indigenous mayan populations .
nearly 20 years later , according to the security sector reform resource centre , levels of violent crime are higher in guatemala than they were during the war .
but despite the high homicide rate , the united nations estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court .
women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny .
in many cases , femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war , including rape , torture and mutilation .
