durham , north carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- president obama 's nomination of loretta lynch to become the country 's first african-american woman attorney general is a historic pick .
her confirmation , however , is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full senate drags into its sixth month .
the period between the senate judiciary committee 's vote to confirm and the full senate vote -- which in lynch 's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history .
by the time the senate returns from easter recess on monday , it 'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined .
obama nominated lynch to replace attorney general eric holder on november 8 , after holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier .
