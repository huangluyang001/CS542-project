it 's not exactly a typical question , but shreeves , who lives in atlanta and is the site manager for the nonprofit keep atlanta beautiful , lives what some may consider an atypical lifestyle : she creates almost no waste .
the small amount of waste shreeves does create goes straight into a 32-ounce mason jar that sits three-quarters full right next to her kitchen sink .
its contents include produce stickers , some paper tea bag wrappers and a long , twisted piece of cotton that went around her toes for a recent pedicure .
