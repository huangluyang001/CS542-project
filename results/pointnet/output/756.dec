-lrb- cnn -rrb- in the hours after the funeral of freddie gray , a community center and apartment complex that local leaders expected to serve as a catalyst for the rebuilding of a long blighted east baltimore neighborhood went up in flames .
the $ 16 million mary harvin transformation center was being built in a part of town where half the properties are vacant buildings or barren lots , where unemployment rates reach 25 % and poverty and despair is rampant .
the project was to include about 60 senior citizen apartments and a community center .
in the works for eight years , the center was to provide behavioral health counseling , support services for people and families with hiv and aids , employment training , home and credit counseling , and ex-offender re-entry services , according to documents filed with the state of maryland .
