a surge of refugees this year , usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels , has sought to reach europe via the libyan coast .
a boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking .
over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of italy in the last week alone .
european leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency .
there is a backstory here worthy of our attention , and it has to do with italy 's colonial past .
many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of italy 's former colonies in north and east africa , namely eritrea -lrb- occupied from 1890-1941 -rrb- and somalia -lrb- 1908-1941 -rrb- .
as migrants , libyans are fewer in number , but libya -lrb- 1912-1941 -rrb- plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for italy .
