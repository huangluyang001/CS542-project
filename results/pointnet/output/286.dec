-lrb- cnn -rrb- a jury of rolling stone 's media peers has dissected the magazine 's disastrous , discredited story about rape on the campus of the university of virginia , and the emerging consensus is that rolling stone 's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine 's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough , devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the columbia university graduate school of journalism .
before the original story , `` a rape on campus , '' was pulled from the rolling stone website , it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in november -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine 's history .
