these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese-born , american-based jia jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about `` 100 days of rejection '' , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born .
famously , in 2012 on his third day of the project , jiang asked austin , texas , krispy kreme manager -lrb- jackie braun -rrb- to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the olympic symbol .
to his surprise , she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered .
he shared his video and it went viral on reddit .
before long , jiang -lrb- and braun -rrb- were invited on talk shows and jiang was being asked to speak at events across the us .
jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew .
