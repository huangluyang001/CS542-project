-lrb- cnn -rrb- north korea accused mexico of illegally holding one of its cargo ships wednesday and demanded the release of the vessel and crew .
the ship , the mu du bong , was detained after it ran aground off the coast of mexico in july .
mexico defended the move wednesday , saying it followed proper protocol because the company that owns the ship , north korea 's ocean maritime management company , has skirted united nations sanctions .
