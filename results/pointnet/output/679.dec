to be raped by your cousin 's husband ; be jailed for adultery as your attacker was married ; to suffer the ignominy of global uproar about your jailing and assault , but be pardoned by presidential decree ; and then to endure the shame and rejection from a conservative society that somehow held you to blame .
that 's what happened to gulnaz , who was barely 16 when she was raped .
she 's now carrying the third child of her attacker , asadullah , who was convicted and jailed -- though this was then reduced .
