last thursday , jeff courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws , metal pieces , three watch heads and some chewed leather straps .
mocha was a repeat offender : just last summer , she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine .
she had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed , parkinson said .
