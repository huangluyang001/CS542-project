twenty years later , domestic terror threats range from white supremacists to eco-terrorists to anti-government extremists and radical separatist groups , according to the fbi .
the fbi 's goal , of course , is to prevent `` homegrown attacks '' before they happen .
unfortunately , this is n't always possible .
when acts of domestic terror do occur , the fbi investigates and tries to catch those responsible .
from mcveigh and nichols to eric rudolph to ted kaczynski , the fbi is often successful , but every once in a while , the suspects get away .
