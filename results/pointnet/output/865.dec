-lrb- cnn -rrb- nasa says its messenger space probe crashed into mercury on thursday after running out of fuel , ending a nearly 11-year journey that provided valuable data and thousands of photos .
mission controllers at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory -lrb- apl -rrb- in laurel , maryland , confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of mercury , as anticipated , at 3:26 p.m. edt , nasa told cnn in an email .
nasa earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet -lrb- 16 meters -rrb- in diameter .
