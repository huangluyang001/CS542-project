to most americans , of course , sen. bernie sanders is only a name , if that .
he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation .
those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left-wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the senate , as we did in 2006 .
let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely -lrb- and with admiration -rrb- for a long time : when people stop to listen to bernie , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear .
