-lrb- rolling stone -rrb- one summer a few years ago , frances bean cobain worked as an intern in the new york offices of rolling stone .
frances -- the daughter of nirvana singer-guitarist kurt cobain and an executive producer of the new hbo documentary on his life , `` kurt cobain : montage of heck '' -- was `` a 15-year-old goth kid , so stoked , '' she recalls with a laugh during a recent interview for the cover story in our new issue .
she remembers providing research assistance on a cover about the jonas brothers -- and working in a cubicle across from a wall with a giant painting of kurt .
`` yeah , '' frances says with a grin and mock-exasperation , `` looking at my dad every day . ''

-rrb- .
that is one of many stories and revelations that come out over almost three hours late one afternoon in early march , as frances , now 22 and a visual artist , speaks publicly for the first time about her father ; life after his death ; her complex relationship with her mother , courtney love ; and the new film , written , directed and produced by brett morgen .
`` kurt got to the point where he eventually had to sacrifice every bit of who he was to his art , because the world demanded it of him , '' frances says bluntly at one point .
`` i think that was one of the main triggers as to why he felt he did n't want to be here and everyone would be happier without him . ''
