the peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over .
the violent response of police officers to unarmed african-americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as `` race card '' politics and black grievance .
but this year 's spate of killings and assaults , from ferguson , missouri , to north charleston , south carolina , to most recently baltimore , are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the african-american community .
to call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed african-americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it .
a true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions .
the loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system .
