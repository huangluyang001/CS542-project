the flows of migrants across the mediterranean are unlikely to stop -- italian authorities estimate that up to 200,000 migrants in libya are waiting to cross , following 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in italy last year .
these flows reflect a significant increase in the number of refugees and internally displaced people across the world , with a total estimate of 51.2 million people .
the latest sinking has triggered some action in the european union , which has unveiled a new ten-point action plan .
the plan includes both deterrent mechanisms , such as efforts to capture and destroy vessels being used by smugglers and a rapid return system , but also an expansion of search-and-rescue programs and a proposed new voluntary resettlement scheme , though it is reported that this may only provide 5,000 spaces .
