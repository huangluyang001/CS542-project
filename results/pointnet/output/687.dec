that 's the account one survivor of the deadly shipwreck gave to investigators , according to a statement released sunday by prosecutors in catania , italy .
the migrant , who spoke to investigators after being airlifted to a hospital in catania , is among dozens who authorities say were saved from the sinking vessel .
he told investigators there were 950 people on board -- a number prosecutors have n't verified .
maltese authorities , who are working with italian rescuers , earlier said around 50 of 700 people on the boat had been saved .
many on lower levels of the boat were trapped inside because smugglers had locked the doors , the migrant said , according to prosecutors .
the italian coast guard is collecting statements from other survivors , prosecutors said .
