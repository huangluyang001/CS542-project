-lrb- cnn -rrb- after two days of deliberation , jurors found dzhokhar tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the boston marathon bombing .
the verdict is n't surprising .
what might be , however , is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again .
because there could be other more young men just like him , which means the lessons we take from boston will affect whether we can keep america and americans safer .
today , nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are muslim .
by 2050 , pew reports , that will be some 1 out of 3 .
by 2070 ?
well , i 'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the drudge report : `` muslims to outnumber christians ! ''
many americans read such numbers and worry : will this mean more dzhokhar tsarnaevs ?
but that 's only if you believe islam causes extremism , which many have argued .
