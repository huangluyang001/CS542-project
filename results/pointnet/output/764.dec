police , trying to save their city last weekend , were blamed both for doing too little and for doing too much .
the ghetto , and i 'm talking class and not race , was on full display by monday .
the whole nation saw beautiful baltimore at its worst .
those who cut fire hoses and burned down homes and businesses ?
police deal with them every day , literally .
those criminals did n't just appear on monday , and they wo n't be gone tomorrow .
they live there , without jobs , education , mainstream social skills , or hope .
