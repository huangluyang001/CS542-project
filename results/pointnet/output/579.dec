-lrb- cnn -rrb- japanese prime minister shinzo abe is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of congress .
the address marks the first time in history that the head of the japanese government will address the entire u.s. congress , and given the importance of the u.s.-japan relationship , it is an invitation long overdue .
so far , prime minister abe 's appearance has garnered much less attention than last month 's speech to congress by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu .
this is not surprising ; in a recent survey by the pew research center nearly three-quarters of the respondents indicated they had `` never heard of '' shinzo abe , underscoring just how difficult it is for the obama administration to sell its much-vaunted `` pivot '' or `` rebalance '' to the american public .
