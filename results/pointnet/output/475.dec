america has the highest incarceration rate in the world , with 5 % of the world 's population and 25 % of its prisoners .
nearly 2 1/2 million americans are in prison .
over 65 million people , or 20 % of the country , have criminal records .
most disturbingly , nearly 40 % of our country 's prisoners are african-americans , who only make up 13 % of the general population .
no wonder america 's prison population is out of control .
americans are n't addicted to crime ; our politicians are addicted to criminalizing things .
