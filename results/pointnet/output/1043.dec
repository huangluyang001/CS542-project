dubai -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's with some trepidation that i set off for the al marmoum camel race in dubai .
as the only gulf national in the cnn team , i am expected to be familiar with camel racing , an ancient tradition in the region .
but despite my attempts to dress in a kandora , a uae national dress , my modern outlook on life means i am a total outsider in this world .
we take our place on the floor and slowly , the world of camel racing begins to open up to us .
