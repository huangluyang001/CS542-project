each month there are around 10,000 license plates available .
at the most recent auction on saturday , li said the final price was 80,600 yuan -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- -- around three times the price of a cheap chinese car and a third of what li plans to spend on his suv .
another option would be to buy a hybrid vehicle that automatically qualifies for a license plate -- a selling point not lost on the car manufacturers showing their latest models and concepts at the shanghai auto show this week .
