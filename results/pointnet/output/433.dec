in south carolina earlier this month , walter scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over $ 18,000 in unpaid child support , according to court records .
that means that once he was stopped , he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion .
but failure to pay child support is not a crime .
at least , not in the traditional sense , though states do criminalize it .
it 's rightly a civil matter .
skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either .
