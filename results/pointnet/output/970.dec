easley , south carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- the cracker or the bite of ice cream -- brynn duncan still is n't sure which one sent her into anaphylactic shock that day .
her food allergies change so frequently , keeping track is almost pointless .
less than a week after her trip to the hospital , brynn , 21 , is back at home in easley , south carolina .
she lies on her back , her head near the foot of her bed , chattering away as her mom changes the access to her chest port .
