obama has argued with the progressive potentate elizabeth warren , calling her `` wrong '' on trade policy .
the massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom hillary clinton has been religiously prostrating .
what everyone does next will be critical for the 2016 elections and the future of democratic politics .
warren has publicly criticized so-called `` fast track '' trade authority that would allow the white house to negotiate massive , multination trade deals with little congressional oversight .
the authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the trans-pacific partnership , which is modeled on the north american free trade agreement , and has killed 700,000 american jobs and drove wages down in the united states while simultaneously decimating mexican agriculture and small businesses .
