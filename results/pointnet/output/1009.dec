the moon slipped fully into earth 's shadow at 4:58 a.m. pacific time -lrb- 7:58 a.m. et -rrb- saturday , starting a total lunar eclipse for nearly five minutes -- what nasa says will be the shortest such eclipse of the century .
the celestial body took on a burnt-orange tint in the minutes before , during and after the total eclipse , giving the moon the appearance that earns total eclipses the `` blood moon '' nickname .
