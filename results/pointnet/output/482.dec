the sum total of television programming , beer advertising , political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of australia 's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation : young -lrb- white -rrb- man plus distant beach equals sacrifice .
more objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game .
to widen the scope of historical tribute , and also recall the words and deeds of the australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment , is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive .
