-lrb- cnn -rrb- espn 's britt mchenry this week found herself in the news , rather than reporting on it , after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in arlington , virginia .
among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to liveleak : `` i 'm on television and you 're in a f**king trailer , honey , '' and `` i would n't work at a scumbag place like this .
makes my skin crawl even being here . ''
and , finally , `` lose some weight , baby girl . ''
it was , however , too late : the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on twitter , where she was called everything from classist , class-less , and `` ugly on the inside '' to a `` sad , self-hating coward . ''
espn , meanwhile , announced that mchenry would be suspended for a week .
