during an expedition through the brittany region on the west coast of france , photographer fabien le coq noticed an unusual tree .
he positioned himself at the base of the tree and turned his camera upward , filling the frame with the trunk and its spindly branches .
the series , shot between 2012 and 2014 , reflects le coq 's travels through his native france and countries in central america and asia .
the images are soothing and repetitive ; each tree is photographed from the bottom looking up .
but it is from this vantage point that the differences become apparent .
