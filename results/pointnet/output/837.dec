-lrb- cnn -rrb- after a weekend shipwreck off the coast of italy that may have killed hundreds of migrants , the international organization for migrants said monday that there may be three more migrant boats in distress in international waters .
authorities still do n't know the fate of many of the passengers , including children , who were on the large ship bound from libya to europe that capsized saturday night in the frigid waters of the mediterranean sea .
that sinking may be the worst in a series of disasters in which migrants have lost their lives on vessels that are too rickety to survive long voyages .
a rescue operation is still underway for people who were on the ship from libya , and the number of potential victims is not clear .
a bangladeshi survivor told investigators there were 950 people on board .
previous estimates put the number around 700 .
