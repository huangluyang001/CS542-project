abc is filming a proof of concept for a revival of `` the muppets , '' the hollywood reporter has learned .
bob kushell -lrb- `` anger management , '' `` 3rd rock from the sun '' -rrb- will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner , with wilfred 's randall einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation .
abc 's `` muppets '' revival is being produced by abc studios and the muppet studios , which disney owns .
the presentation is set to film next weekend on the disney lot in burbank with some of the original muppet performers returning .
sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by jim henson -- kermit the frog , fozzie bear , gonzo and animal , among others -- gathering at abc studios for a meeting about the new `` muppet show . ''
however , the show wo n't move forward unless miss piggy signs on , and her current relationship with frequent love kermit is on the rocks , preventing the show from getting off the ground .
early plans call for two celebrity cameos -- including miss piggy 's current co-star -- as well as new roles including fozzie 's girlfriend and her parents .
