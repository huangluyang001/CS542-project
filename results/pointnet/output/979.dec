but this catholic had n't read it -- at least , not from cover to cover .
so , in the middle of holy week , i decided to finally take the plunge .
my name is laura bernardini and i 'm a director of coverage at cnn , which means i manage our newsgathering and newsroom in washington .
i 'm also a lifelong catholic .
