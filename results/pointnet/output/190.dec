-lrb- cnn -rrb- the new emojis are here !
on thursday , apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n't cut it .
why is any of this important , you may ask ?
for many , these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting .
rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity , sexual orientation , race or even hair color is part of mainstream america -- despite what others might say .
this matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day .
